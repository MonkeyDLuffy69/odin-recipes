            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For topping
            <ul>
                <li>1 tsp Cardamom</li>
                <li>1 tbsp Almonds & pistachios</li>
                <li>1 tbsp Milk(with 1/2 tsp saffron has been rubbed in silver foil)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare sugar syrup of 1 thread consistency</li>
        <li>Take solidified ghee in a large wide bowl. Taking one ice cube at a time, rub the ghee vigorously. Take more ice cubes as required, till ghee becomes very white.</li>
        <li>Add milk, flour and a cup of water. Mix to make a smooth batter.</li>
        <li>Dissolve colour in some water and add this to the batter. Add more water if required. Batter should be fairly thin (it should run off easily when poured from a spoon).</li>
        <li>Take an aluminium or steel cylindrical container (do not use lid). The height should be at least 12" and diameter 5-6". Fill the container half with ghee. Heat it.</li>
        <li>When the ghee is smoky hot, take a 50 ml glass full of batter. Pour in centre of ghee, slowly in one continuous threadlike stream. Allow foam to settle. Pour one more glassful in the hole formed in centre.</li>
        <li>When foam settles again, loosen ghewar with an iron skewer inserted in hole. Lift carefully, at a slant, and place on wire mesh to drain. Keep the hot syrup in a wide flat bottomed container to fit in ghevar. Dip ghevar in it, and remove, keep aside on mesh to drain excess syrup.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, pour some syrup evenly all over, keeping ghevar in a mesh placed over a container. Cool a little, top with silver foil.</li>
        <li>Splash a few drops of saffron milk, sprinkle some chopped dry fruit and a few pinches of cardamom powder.</li>
        <li>Serve. One may also serve ghevar with rabri prepared in advance.</li>
    </ol>
